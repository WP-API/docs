# Global Parameters

The API includes a number of global parameters (also called "meta-parameters") which control how the API handles the request/response handling. These operate at a layer above the actual resources themselves, and are available on all resources.


## `_jsonp`

The API natively supports [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) responses to allow cross-domain requests for legacy browsers and clients. This parameter takes a JavaScript callback function which will be prepended to the data. This URL can then be loaded via a `<script>` tag.

The callback function can contain any alphanumeric, `_` (underscore), or `.` (period) character. Callbacks which contain invalid characters will receive a HTTP 400 error response, and the callback will not be called.

[info]
Modern browsers can use [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) preflight requests for cross-domain requests, but JSONP can be used to ensure support with all browsers.

[/info]

For example:

```html
<script>
function receiveData( data ) {
  // Do something with the data here.
  // For demonstration purposes, we'll simply log it.
  console.log( data );
}
</script>
<script src="https://demo.wp-api.org/wp-json/?_jsonp=receiveData"></script>
```


## `_method` (or `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header)

Some servers and clients cannot correctly process some HTTP methods that the API makes use of. For example, all deletion requests on resources use the `DELETE` method, but some clients do not provide the ability to send this method.

To ensure compatibility with these servers and clients, the API supports a method override. This can be passed either via a `_method` parameter or the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, with the value set to the HTTP method to use.

[alert]
Clients should only ever send a method override parameter or header with POST requests. Using the method override with GET requests may cause the request to be incorrectly cached.
[/alert]

A `POST` to `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/42?_method=DELETE` would be translated to a `DELETE` to the `wp/v2/posts/42` route.

Similarly, the following POST request would become a DELETE:

```
POST /wp-json/wp/v2/posts/42 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE
```


## `_envelope`

Similarly to `_method`, some servers, clients, and proxies do not support accessing the full response data. The API supports passing an `_envelope` parameter, which sends all response data in the body, including headers and status code.

Envelope mode is enabled if the `_envelope` parameter is passed in the query string (GET parameter). This parameter does not require a value (i.e. `?_envelope` is valid), but can be passed "1" as a value if required by a client library.

[info]
For future compatibility, other values should not be passed.
[/info]

Enveloped responses include a "fake" HTTP 200 response code with no additional headers (apart from Content-Type) that should ensure the response correctly passes through intermediaries.

For example, given the following response to a `GET` to `wp/v2/users/me`:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/42

{
  "id": 42,
  ...
}
```

The equivalent enveloped response (with a `GET` to `wp/v2/users/me?_envelope`) would be:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "status": 302,
  "headers": {
    "Location": "http://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/42"
  },
  "body": {
    "id": 42
  }
}
```


## `_embed`

Most resources include links to related resources. For example, a post can link to the parent post, or to comments on the post. To reduce the number of HTTP requests required, clients may wish to fetch a resource as well as the linked resources. The `_embed` parameter indicates to the server that the response should include these embedded resources.

Embed mode is enabled if the `_embed` parameter is passed in the query string (GET parameter). This parameter does not require a value (i.e. `?_embed` is valid), however can be passed "1" as a value if required by a client library.

[info]
For future compatibility, other values should not be passed.
[/info]

Resources in embed mode will contain an additional `_embedded` key next to the `_links` key containing the linked resources. Only links with the `embeddable` parameter set to `true` will be embedded.
